# Visualizations - Group 30


The following visualization app is composed of two files; main and app.

Regarding, the main source of data used for this project it can be obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata . However, at first instance the dataset only includes 10 out of the 26 available columns, please make sure to select all, as we used many of these for different cases.

The additional data, gives the polygon points of the neighbourhoods of New York City as geojson file, which is crucial to encode the visualizations as choropleth maps. It can be found in: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ . It is needed to look for the name of New York City, even though this can be done by pressing Ctrl+F and writing New York. The file that should be downloaded is 'neighbourhoods.geojson'.
